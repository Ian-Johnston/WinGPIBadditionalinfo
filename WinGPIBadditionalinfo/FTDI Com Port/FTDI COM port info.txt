If you install the FTDI driver software then it will appear in Device Manager under PORTS as FTDI......
But this won't work properly.
Doesn't work with WinGPIB
Doesn't work with RealTerm
Does appear to work with TeraTerm

It has to appear in Device Manager as "USB Serial Port (ComX)" where X is your port number.

Zadig doesn't help despite changing the driver type. It has to appear in ZADIG as FTDIBUS (v2.12.6.0) but the selection to do so is not listed.

So, in Device Manager right click UPDATE DRIVER and select BROWSE FOR DRIVERS ON MY COMPUTER
Then at the bottom select LET ME PICK FROM A LIST OF AVAILABLE DRIVERS ON MY COMPUTER, and select USB Serial Port Version........
HAVE DISK is an option but I dodn't need to do that.

Note:
Ahead of all this I had installed the FTDIPORT.inf and FTDIBUS.inf drivers manually (right click).

Done.
